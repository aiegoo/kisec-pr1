TODAY’S Detailed Approach (Scenario).

1. Initial Setup & OSINT (Pre-Engagement)
     1.1 Connect via AnyDesk:
           - Get access to the VMBox/Docker environment.
           - Confirming tools are installed (or request installation):
                        - Pentesting: Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, OWASP ZAP.
                        - OSINT: theHarvester, Shodan, SpiderFoot.
                        - Code Analysis: SADT, Bandit (Python), Semgrep.
                        - Monitoring: Wazuh, Sysinternals.

2. OSINT Reconnaissance:
        2.1 Monitoring: Wazuh, Sysinternals.
        2.2 Running theHarvester to find subdomains/emails
        2.3 Checking for leaks with Shodan
        2.4 Documenting findings on GitHub.
