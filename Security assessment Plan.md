   SECURITY ASSESSMET PLAN
 
1️Environment & Initial Assessment
Review system architecture, network topology, and firewall configurations.


Validate Docker and VM configurations for Red/Blue team scenarios.


Assess access control mechanisms, including SSO implementation.


2️OSINT & Reconnaissance
Conduct Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to identify external threats.


Perform network scanning (e.g., Nmap, Shodan) to detect exposed services.


Enumerate assets and gather intelligence for further testing.


3️Web Application & Infrastructure Security Testing
Perform vulnerability assessment and penetration testing on web applications.


Analyze authentication mechanisms, including SSO misconfigurations.


Simulate attack scenarios such as SQL Injection, XSS, and privilege escalation.


4️Security Monitoring & Threat Detection
Deploy and configure monitoring tools (e.g., Wazuh, Sysinternals) for real-time analysis.


Set up log monitoring and threat detection mechanisms.


Identify and document any anomalous activity.


5️Reporting & Documentation
Document findings, exploited vulnerabilities, and remediation steps.


Maintain a structured GitHub repository for documentation.


Deliver a comprehensive security playbook for implementation.
